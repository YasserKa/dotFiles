2017-06-18 21:01:49	greycat	all those $@ need to be "$@" also
2017-06-18 21:02:35	Celmor	but wouldn't the binary see multiple strings then instead of a single one?
2017-06-18 21:02:46	Celmor	err, the other way around
2017-06-18 21:03:18	Celmor	dunno how pacman behaves if it received "a b" rather than "a" "b"
2017-06-18 21:03:34	greycat	!$@
2017-06-18 21:03:34	greybot	The difference between $@ and $*: Without quotes (don't do this!), there is no difference. With double quotes, "$@" expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ..., while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c...", where 'c' is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@" (QUOTED!). The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}".
2017-06-18 21:03:50	Celmor	ok
2017-06-18 21:04:36	Celmor	and if I wanted to give pacman a parameter via arguments to my script? will pacman see '--download-only' as a parameter or an argument?

2017-07-26 20:26:18	greycat	Only if you wanted to recurse, and then it would be just find, not grep.

2017-07-26 20:30:09	greycat	Smirnov: if the glob matches nothing, it is not replaced.  You get the literal glob as the 0th array element.
