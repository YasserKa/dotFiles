2017-06-18 21:01:49	greycat	all those $@ need to be "$@" also
2017-06-18 21:02:35	Celmor	but wouldn't the binary see multiple strings then instead of a single one?
2017-06-18 21:02:46	Celmor	err, the other way around
2017-06-18 21:03:18	Celmor	dunno how pacman behaves if it received "a b" rather than "a" "b"
2017-06-18 21:03:34	greycat	!$@
2017-06-18 21:03:34	greybot	The difference between $@ and $*: Without quotes (don't do this!), there is no difference. With double quotes, "$@" expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ..., while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c...", where 'c' is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@" (QUOTED!). The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}".
2017-06-18 21:03:50	Celmor	ok
2017-06-18 21:04:36	Celmor	and if I wanted to give pacman a parameter via arguments to my script? will pacman see '--download-only' as a parameter or an argument?

2017-07-26 20:26:18	greycat	Only if you wanted to recurse, and then it would be just find, not grep.

2017-07-26 20:30:09	greycat	Smirnov: if the glob matches nothing, it is not replaced.  You get the literal glob as the 0th array element.

2017-09-24 21:05:15	glacial	because FIFO should have both of its ends used (read end should be opened for reading and write end should be opened for writing) before a redirect like `>fifo' will take effect (i.e. will result in opened FD of write end of pipe, it will unfreeze and execution of the command will continue)

2017-09-25 12:38:53	trasckore	it happens both with vim and nano
2017-09-25 12:39:42	alcohol	can you be more specific about the error?
2017-09-25 12:39:45	trasckore	sure
2017-09-25 12:40:11	trasckore	"no such file or directory"
2017-09-25 12:40:16	alcohol	does /etc/bash exist?
2017-09-25 12:40:34	alcohol	for me it is /etc/bash.bashrc/
2017-09-25 12:40:43	trasckore	no
2017-09-25 12:40:46	trasckore	ok
2017-09-25 12:40:50	alcohol	or rather, that is the default global
2017-09-25 12:41:02	alcohol	sorry, not a directory, just a file (/etc/bash.bashrc)
2017-09-25 12:42:25	alcohol	and that file is called from /etc/profile
2017-09-25 12:42:42	trasckore	alcohol, to take effect
2017-09-25 12:42:46	alcohol	could just be my distro flavoring though, not sure if that is default bash convention
2017-09-25 12:42:46	trasckore	i need to reboot?
2017-09-25 12:42:51	alcohol	no
2017-09-25 12:43:02	alcohol	but you might have to re-init your shell session
2017-09-25 12:43:25	alcohol	depends on what you want to 'take efect'

2017-09-28 12:18:13	rond_	Hi! when I do "parallel -j 2 --retries 10000 -a in.in cat" and during this I create a file with filename matching the second line in in.in, I would expect that it's content would be read and another job would be run. But, unfortunately, parallel doesn't care that the appropriate file was created; both jobs run the same time, with the first one returning "no such file" and second one returning the content of the appropriate file.
2017-09-28 12:18:16	rond_	 The question is: why isn't this content read in the second it could be? Why the hell this second job waits as long as the first one? The first one cannot execute command, so it's understandable it retries and retries, but the second one DO CAN execute command, so why it doesn't?

2017-09-28 14:46:58	cousteau	er never mind; I thought geirha's advice somehow caused printf to print raw stuff

2017-09-28 14:49:00	system16	it is a bash question
2017-09-28 14:49:04	 *	cousteau is curious too because he's had similar problems
2017-09-28 14:49:35	geirha	not really, but it depends on what filesystem it has

2017-09-28 14:50:25	geirha	then ask your OS channel how to change ownership and or mode
2017-09-28 14:51:21	cousteau	I'm with geirha here; it's something linux-related (or whatever's-your-OS-related), not bash-related
2017-09-28 14:51:21	system16	ok but bash is a shell shell talks to my pc so it has something to do with bash

2017-09-28 14:52:12	pj	and your PC is in house or office somewhere, why don't you ask the landlord because it has as much to do with him as with bash.
2017-09-28 14:52:23	geirha	You can use bash to start a virtual machine running windows too, that doesn't make windows on-topic here

2017-09-28 14:52:30	greybot	Bash is a shell. That's a program which can do simple math, logic, I/O and run other programs. It's NOT a terminal, it's not a kernel, it doesn't manage the system's authentication or environment, it's not your OS and it's not X, KDE or Gnome.
