2017-06-21 08:41:30	yasser	Hey, guys. Is it possible to change the sensitivity of the page scroll while using (j,k,l,h)?
2017-06-21 08:41:53	yasser	I didn't use firefox ever before, but depending on vimperator I might switch to it :)
2017-06-21 08:42:36	yasser	Comming from vimium the scroll sens. in vimper. is pretty annoying.
2017-06-21 08:51:12	yasser	nvm, I should add that to *can google* category.

2017-06-23 08:24:38	yasser	Hey, is there a reason for having to press ;o in bmarks, instead of Enter to navigate to the page?
2017-06-23 08:25:24	yasser	I can't think of a single reason for this unfriendly design decision.
