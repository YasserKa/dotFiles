2017-09-21 20:55:12	yasser	Hey guys, anyone here uses vim while editing scripts in unity?
2017-09-21 20:55:33	merpnderp_	Stupid that the debugger would make assumptions about how much precision I'd want to see from a float.
2017-09-21 20:55:53	merpnderp_	yasser: I use vim mode in VSCode :)
2017-09-21 20:56:12	yasser	Yeah, that's a plugin for vim.

2017-09-21 20:56:52	yasser	No, I am talking about pure vim. I was just wondering if you get to have all the autocompletetions if you use omnisharp
