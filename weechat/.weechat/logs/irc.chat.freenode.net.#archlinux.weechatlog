2017-06-16 10:47:25	hollunder	Thanks grawity and esph, mounting the EFI partition to /boot solved it, upgrading to the newest kernel did not require a manual step
2017-06-16 10:47:55	yasser1	Hello guys, I am going through https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Easy-RSA , and it says that I need 2 machines - one for the clinet and another for the server -. How to go around this?

2017-06-16 10:48:01	physkets	Has anybody here attempted setting up SecureBoot with one's own keys? I was wondering if I also needed to sign the intel ucode image and the initramfs files.

2017-06-16 10:49:37	grawity	yasser1: easy-rsa doesn't have "clients" nor "servers"
2017-06-16 10:49:41	esph	hollunder: now you can nuke your old /boot partition if it was a partition, or unmount your ESP (remount it after) and remove everything under /boot if it was just a directory on your / partition (since those files will always be hidden by your ESP / /boot and are just taking up space)
2017-06-16 10:49:51	grawity	yasser1: the software you're making the certs *for*, like OpenVPN or whatever, has clients and servers

2017-06-16 10:50:20	yasser1	Ah, I see thanks for the clarification.
2017-06-16 10:50:36	yasser1	Yeah, I came from OpenVPN to Easy-RSA
2017-06-16 10:50:40	hollunder	esph, good idea to clean that up
