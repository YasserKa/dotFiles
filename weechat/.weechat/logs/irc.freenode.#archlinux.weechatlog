2017-06-18 20:48:06	earnestly	ngkaho1234: Just a monitor with a semaphore, nothing particularly complicated.  The main flaws of these primatives were that it was so easy to break, since you can cause failure by simply using it wrong (entering a critical and forgetting to check and set the flag).  Higher levels, like CSP or Ada's CSP-ish bi-direction rendezvous are much safer in that a bad actor can't wreck the entire thing

So let's try and figure this out from zero knowledge, frustrating because this is a set that is usually not necessary, but try to find out where the binary `pamac-daemon' is located

2017-06-20 21:41:04	CompanionCube	that's a special kind of brokenness. Might it've been PAM (the only glibc bit would be nsswitch)?

2017-06-20 21:42:41	tyzoid	It should show your accelerated unit if drivers/codecs are installed

Initially they didn't want to fix the issue as it might be that the vte daemon is running in one locale and the system running in another (by locale, I mean the charset specifically).  I mean this is broken anyway, but once that was dropped now it's a case of "we might break unknown users".  which is odd to me, because there are literally dozens of reports of

2017-06-30 21:06:46	@phrik	sangy: Bazinga!
2017-06-30 21:06:48	MacGyver	Tom^: It actually works just fine for me.
2017-06-30 21:06:57	eschwartz	sangy: I suggest you rewrite the whole project from scratch for them, it'll be faster
2017-06-30 21:07:04	sangy	lol
2017-06-30 21:07:11	MacGyver	Tom^: As long as I remember to switch the scheduler to round-robin and use the CPUs I normally have isolcpu'd for the VM.
2017-06-30 21:07:11	sangy	that module at least feels like it
2017-06-30 21:07:20	sangy	for some reason I believe they are not aware of tmpfile
2017-06-30 21:07:38	BrainDamage	maybe we're misinterpreting the term, "reproducible builds" don't refer about repeatability, rather the capability of such horrible software to self reproduce and infest a system
2017-06-30 21:07:44	MacGyver	Tom^: The issue I'm *currently* having is that the drivers / firmware for the particular family of Radeon card I have (R9 390) is quite bugged.
2017-06-30 21:07:52	MacGyver	Tom^: Unbind produces a kernel oops.
2017-06-30 21:07:58	sangy	BrainDamage: I'd be with you on that, but the thing does work like a charm
2017-06-30 21:07:58	Tom^	MacGyver: huh round robin?
2017-06-30 21:08:06	Tom^	MacGyver: isolcpued?
2017-06-30 21:08:06	eschwartz	It reminds me of my friend who is currently rewriting a series of perl management scripts into bash for the company he works at.
2017-06-30 21:08:10	Tom^	MacGyver: HALP i want moar fps
2017-06-30 21:08:18	eschwartz	Which also does shellscripts like that
2017-06-30 21:08:20	MacGyver	Tom^: Yeah, so, normally I game in a qemu/kvm vm, right?
2017-06-30 21:08:26	Tom^	MacGyver: oh ok
2017-06-30 21:08:41	MacGyver	Tom^: In order to minimize the stutter for that, I boot with isolcpus=2-5,8-11.
2017-06-30 21:08:54	MacGyver	Tom^: That basically means that linux won't schedule anything on those cores / hyperthreads.

2017-06-30 21:09:08	eschwartz	*But* with the added benefit of all files using Windows line endings, and only working when copypasted into a GUI management console which then runs the perl scripts and in the process fixes the line endings.
2017-06-30 21:09:15	MacGyver	Tom^: And libvirt pins its virtual CPU threads to those cores.

2017-06-30 21:09:47	MacGyver	Tom^: Now if the VM *isn't* running, and you want to run something on those cores, you can taskset it to a single one of those cores explicitly under the default scheduler (SCHED_OTHER).
2017-06-30 21:10:05	MacGyver	Tom^: If you use a *group* in taskset, under SCHED_OTHER, it will simply run everything on the lowest number in the group.

2017-06-30 21:10:45	Tom^	which of none should really affect since im not running in a VM.
2017-06-30 21:10:47	Tom^	heh
2017-06-30 21:10:51	MacGyver	It actually worked fine for my scientific computing.
2017-06-30 21:11:01	MacGyver	Tom^: But if you use a group in taskset, under SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR, it will distribute over the cores.
2017-06-30 21:11:15	Tom^	unless ofc my sheduler sucks
2017-06-30 21:11:27	MacGyver	Tom^: So I just start steam with chrt --rr 1 taskset "2-5,8-11" steam-native.
2017-06-30 21:11:45	MacGyver	Tom^: And then all the gaming happens on those otherwise unoccupied cores.

2017-06-30 21:12:35	MacGyver	Tom^: CPU groups or whatever it's called; I recall the term "shield".
2017-06-30 21:12:38	Tom^	it probably shouldnt

2017-09-26 10:27:37	lswart	Or I wonder if I should be taking a different approach to package management on Arch, perhaps by moving to Stack
2017-09-26 10:27:56	speak	Arch and Haskell, I just assume everything is broken, but I'm safe in my little contained Stack environment
2017-09-26 10:29:34	lswart	speak: Do you get the errors too? I understand that the Arch packages don't include the html docs, so those warnings are understandable. It's the messages like these that concern me: `xmonad-contrib-0.13: dependency "xmonad-0.13-BD2NHZ6woCmKiljsMS6jfz" doesn't exist (ignoring)`
2017-09-26 10:30:06	speak	I do get those sorts of errors at times when I touch anything haskell related, sorry I can't recall exactly when I got those now or what they were

2017-09-26 10:30:29	lswart	speak: Do you use xmonad, or other programs that are critical to your workflow? If so, do you have them installed via Arch or Stack?
2017-09-26 10:30:34	grawity	that doesn't sound broken tbh
2017-09-26 10:30:43	lswart	speak: Ah, ok. Thanks for the input
2017-09-26 10:30:51	grawity	it's just the pre-upgrade hook doing things lazily
2017-09-26 10:30:56	grawity	(alphabetically)
2017-09-26 10:30:59	speak	grawity: Not broken yeah, just alarming and warnings upon system update are usually a sign of "something went wrong"

2017-09-28 14:35:57	earnestly	grazzolini: The major flaw with runit for example is how it polls; basically if a service fails it retries it every one second until it succeeds.

When we start introducing notification systems it's possible to remove these wakeups but at a lot of more complexity, and if done

2017-09-28 14:44:12	earnestly	Tazmain: A lot of people talk about boilerplate in their code, stuff that's necessary but can be essentially generated or copy-pasted

2017-09-28 14:46:15	earnestly	dreisner: But I only mention it because the whole thing was designed for the "container" idea, called zones in Solaris, pretty much from the beginning and so have a bunch of tooling/infra already for it

2017-09-28 14:49:50	homerj	oh, and the quickest way to solve a problem, is to demonstrate it's not your problem, so you don't have to solve it
