2017-06-18 21:38:23	ARI__	Hi, I'm trying to create a simple vim plugin and I've created my plugin file under .vim/plugged/vim-update-buffers/plugin/vim-update-buffers.vim
2017-06-18 21:38:43	romainl	so far so good
2017-06-18 21:38:53	ARI__	It contains a simple function that I am trying to run using :call MyFunctionName()
2017-06-18 21:39:09	ARI__	this is my first plugin but it looks like my vim isn't picking it up
2017-06-18 21:39:24	romainl	you must restart Vim for that
2017-06-18 21:39:33	romainl	or manually source your file

2017-06-22 21:01:49	fow	hm maybe your Vim doesn't support that register

2017-06-22 21:03:08	fow	The 0 means your Vim doesn't have support for the * or + registers
2017-06-22 21:03:38	cjohnson	:r! pbpaste
2017-06-22 21:03:40	cjohnson	that works
2017-06-22 21:03:43	cjohnson	and I see the control chars
2017-06-22 21:03:46	fow	ah cool
2017-06-22 21:03:54	cjohnson	So I'll have to set up a hotkey
2017-06-22 21:04:02	fow	you'd have to install a version of Vim with features for the * and + register if you want to use those
2017-06-22 21:04:15	fow	IIRC OSX ships with a Vim that isn't fully functional, so you might get some other goodies too
2017-06-22 21:04:24	fow	(I'm not the best authority on that though 'cause I've never really used OSX)
2017-06-22 21:05:04	cjohnson	Oh. I already have a mapping for pbpaste and pbcopy haha
