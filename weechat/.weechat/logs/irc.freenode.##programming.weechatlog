2017-06-30 21:52:28	bsrm_	well that's not a solution
2017-06-30 21:52:34	bsrm_	your idea would work fine
2017-06-30 21:52:35	Tempus2	Well, you need an algoritm in order to find out. And rules to determain what belongs to an island and not.
2017-06-30 21:52:36	quiz96	and you haven't defined an algorithm?
2017-06-30 21:52:37	bsrm_	if you implement it properly

2017-06-30 21:53:14	bsrm_	i've had a similar interview question and I basically called a recursive function on each 'unseen' element of the original 2d array, and ran a recursive function on that element which checks its neighbors

2017-06-30 21:53:32	bsrm_	that's probably what you're getting at i'm guessing
2017-06-30 21:53:44	nupogodi	lol ok my solution is to search the array left to right, top to bottom, for each node find the maximum island greedily (recursively), and memoize it so if you check the node again you don't do all that nonsense
2017-06-30 21:53:55	bsrm_	yes that's exactly how I'd approach it
2017-06-30 21:54:23	nupogodi	exactly. it's Run Length Encoding except binary

2017-06-30 21:54:54	nupogodi	Amazon Canada.

2017-06-30 21:55:11	bsrm_	i mean i've h ad t he exact same interview question from a startup once and they liked it
2017-06-30 21:55:20	bsrm_	so maybe Amazon wanted something more optimized? hard to say

2017-06-30 21:55:38	nupogodi	I think memoizing after being greedy is kinda the most optimization you can do there
2017-06-30 21:55:39	quiz96	maybe, this is a pretty brute force solution
2017-06-30 21:55:51	+graff	bsrm_: i would not take it personally. these large companies seem to be condusting suvery-research along with their interview process
2017-06-30 21:55:53	nupogodi	there is no way to quickly find a solution
2017-06-30 21:55:57	bsrm_	I agree, i wouldn't
2017-06-30 21:56:03	bsrm_	as  someone who failed an onsite interview monday :)
2017-06-30 21:56:10	bsrm_	and also didnt know why they didnt like my solution
2017-06-30 21:56:10	bsrm_	lol
2017-06-30 21:56:13	+graff	essentially they are paying for thier own time by testing the limits of what people know
2017-06-30 21:56:29	Tempus2	Maybe Amazon already have their hands on a more optimized way, and wanted people that would be able to think that way?

2017-06-30 21:59:48	+graff	but i am not really sure even what you would do. i mean without the actual formulas and algorithms written out and anotated who would even care?
2017-06-30 22:00:09	nupogodi	Amazon is pretty cool though, my interview process basically involved an online technical screening

2017-07-27 21:08:00	+graff	anything in ascii that is a control character
2017-07-27 21:08:01	mrig	yasser, they are the ones that you can not see, like enter.
2017-07-27 21:08:09	yasser	ohhhh
2017-07-27 21:08:36	yasser	so like /n /t /s /r EOF
2017-07-27 21:08:53	+graff	EOF is not actually a character

2017-07-27 21:09:25	yasser	yup
2017-07-27 21:09:32	mrig	well there are others that dont effect the screen at all too, like the print screen button
2017-07-27 21:09:35	yasser	I am using /buffer so mixed up that
2017-07-27 21:09:57	mrig	and the terminal bell :)
2017-07-27 21:10:21	yasser	I always tried to see what happens when I use that character. \a was it? nothing happens.
2017-07-27 21:10:40	mrig	\v is cool

2017-07-27 21:12:06	+graff	if it not a control character and it is not a space then it is a non-graphical character
2017-07-27 21:12:25	+graff	in the sense of the C standard library ctypes
2017-07-27 21:12:50	yasser	btw, any idea how to detect a tab stop?
2017-07-27 21:12:59	yasser	it's not \t right?
2017-07-27 21:13:08	+graff	isgraph() checks for any printable character except space.
2017-07-27 21:13:16	+graff	isprint() checks for any printable character including space.

2017-07-27 21:14:10	yasser	how to know the number if spaces used in that?
2017-07-27 21:14:30	+graff	but a terminal tab stop itself is different.

2017-07-27 21:14:37	yasser	Exercise 1-20. Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number 
2017-07-27 21:14:37	yasser	of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns. 
2017-07-27 21:14:37	yasser	Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter?  
2017-07-27 21:14:46	yasser	I got that exercise
2017-07-27 21:15:03	+graff	you may have to use a function like this if you are writing an editor: int vlencnt(int ch, int col) { if ( ch == '\t' ) return tabstop - (col % tabstop); return 1;

2017-07-27 21:16:53	mrig	cool graff I've noted that one.
2017-07-27 21:16:55	yasser	whats*
2017-07-27 21:17:06	+graff	where col is your number of terminal columns and ch is the character. tabstop in this case is a macro or global like: int tabstop = 8;
2017-07-27 21:17:28	yasser	ah, so you decide on the number.
2017-07-27 21:18:04	+graff	yeah but that can probably also be coordinated with the terminal. but that is more advanced
2017-07-27 21:18:24	yasser	thanks, I did that already by deciding the number of spaces for the tab. I thought that I was wrong :)
2017-07-27 21:18:36	mrig	ah just mulling that over, of course yes.

2017-07-27 21:19:50	yasser	who cares if your code is clean \shrug
2017-07-27 21:20:09	+graff	typical of people who tried to write an editor and failed to not like tabs or line wrapping
2017-07-27 21:20:20	+graff	much easier without those two things
