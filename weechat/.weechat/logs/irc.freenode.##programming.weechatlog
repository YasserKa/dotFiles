2017-06-30 21:52:28	bsrm_	well that's not a solution
2017-06-30 21:52:34	bsrm_	your idea would work fine
2017-06-30 21:52:35	Tempus2	Well, you need an algoritm in order to find out. And rules to determain what belongs to an island and not.
2017-06-30 21:52:36	quiz96	and you haven't defined an algorithm?
2017-06-30 21:52:37	bsrm_	if you implement it properly

2017-06-30 21:53:14	bsrm_	i've had a similar interview question and I basically called a recursive function on each 'unseen' element of the original 2d array, and ran a recursive function on that element which checks its neighbors

2017-06-30 21:53:32	bsrm_	that's probably what you're getting at i'm guessing
2017-06-30 21:53:44	nupogodi	lol ok my solution is to search the array left to right, top to bottom, for each node find the maximum island greedily (recursively), and memoize it so if you check the node again you don't do all that nonsense
2017-06-30 21:53:55	bsrm_	yes that's exactly how I'd approach it
2017-06-30 21:54:23	nupogodi	exactly. it's Run Length Encoding except binary

2017-06-30 21:54:54	nupogodi	Amazon Canada.

2017-06-30 21:55:11	bsrm_	i mean i've h ad t he exact same interview question from a startup once and they liked it
2017-06-30 21:55:20	bsrm_	so maybe Amazon wanted something more optimized? hard to say

2017-06-30 21:55:38	nupogodi	I think memoizing after being greedy is kinda the most optimization you can do there
2017-06-30 21:55:39	quiz96	maybe, this is a pretty brute force solution
2017-06-30 21:55:51	+graff	bsrm_: i would not take it personally. these large companies seem to be condusting suvery-research along with their interview process
2017-06-30 21:55:53	nupogodi	there is no way to quickly find a solution
2017-06-30 21:55:57	bsrm_	I agree, i wouldn't
2017-06-30 21:56:03	bsrm_	as  someone who failed an onsite interview monday :)
2017-06-30 21:56:10	bsrm_	and also didnt know why they didnt like my solution
2017-06-30 21:56:10	bsrm_	lol
2017-06-30 21:56:13	+graff	essentially they are paying for thier own time by testing the limits of what people know
2017-06-30 21:56:29	Tempus2	Maybe Amazon already have their hands on a more optimized way, and wanted people that would be able to think that way?

2017-06-30 21:59:48	+graff	but i am not really sure even what you would do. i mean without the actual formulas and algorithms written out and anotated who would even care?
2017-06-30 22:00:09	nupogodi	Amazon is pretty cool though, my interview process basically involved an online technical screening

2017-07-27 21:16:55	yasser	whats*
2017-07-27 21:17:06	+graff	where col is your number of terminal columns and ch is the character. tabstop in this case is a macro or global like: int tabstop = 8;
2017-07-27 21:17:28	yasser	ah, so you decide on the number.
2017-07-27 21:18:04	+graff	yeah but that can probably also be coordinated with the terminal. but that is more advanced
2017-07-27 21:18:24	yasser	thanks, I did that already by deciding the number of spaces for the tab. I thought that I was wrong :)

If you happen to intentionally have an include file that overlaps another, for instance, specifying a macro or other define that could have been specified elsewhere. You might intentionally insert one include first.  Is this always an issue? No.  But it can be by design.

2017-09-26 11:30:05	merijn	vendu: Sadly I only have a positive recommendation about the type checking side of things. And a negative recommendation for the Dragon book (it is severely dated and wastes too much time on minutiae of parsing)

2017-09-26 11:30:51	merijn	Most compiler courses I'm familiar with (including ours) use a small syllabus combined with lots of hands-on coding over a specific book
2017-09-26 11:30:55	+vendu	merijn, oh i have a small assembler too :)
2017-09-26 11:31:07	+vendu	which doesn't use anything external for parsing/grammar etc. :P
2017-09-26 11:31:20	+vendu	so it's ad hoc (luckily, assembly isn't hard to parse)
2017-09-26 11:31:22	personlearner	Thanks :(
2017-09-26 11:31:27	+vendu	for the most part, c isn't either :)
2017-09-26 11:31:43	merijn	vendu: Are you hand-writing the parser, using flex/bison, or using ANTLR?
2017-09-26 11:31:53	+vendu	merijn, by hand :)
2017-09-26 11:31:56	merijn	C is easy-peasy to parse. C++ is hell :)

2017-09-26 11:50:41	DocTator	swap space.

2017-09-26 11:50:47	grouse	Xatenev, fwiw
2017-09-26 11:50:57	DocTator	you can pretend you have more ram than you actually have.
2017-09-26 11:50:58	+vendu	Xatenev, the hyde book is quite practical :)
2017-09-26 11:51:00	Xatenev	grouse, its on my pc already
2017-09-26 11:51:01	Xatenev	grouse, heh
2017-09-26 11:51:06	grouse	Xatenev, well fancy that :P
2017-09-26 11:51:10	DocTator	well, rathe, you can make your computer think you have more RAM than you actually have
2017-09-26 11:51:27	merijn	Virtual memory is so much more than making your computer think you have more RAM than you have
2017-09-26 11:51:28	mniip	how would I approach this practical task
2017-09-26 11:51:36	merijn	That is why it was invented, but not what makes it useful today
2017-09-26 11:51:37	Xatenev	vendu, grouse merijn I  will read all of the books
2017-09-26 11:51:38	+beaky	ye surely virtual memory is more than merely being swap space

2017-09-28 13:57:53	merijn	Tazmain: Basically, "I hate writing tests, what if I could just prove it did the correct thing, then I don't have to write tests!" :p
2017-09-28 13:58:35	merijn	Tazmain: So it's all about how do you prove properties about a program. Trivial beginner examples would be things like "prove that reversing a list twice indeed produces the original list again"
2017-09-28 13:59:01	merijn	Tazmain: It starts from proving really simple things and build up to modelling and proving things on more complex imperative programs
2017-09-28 13:59:03	cdt5050	merijn: coq is a prolog?
2017-09-28 13:59:28	+beaky	Tazmain: coq lets you write formal specs & interactively prove such specs (i.e. the 'verification' approach mentioned in that atlatinc article), extract your running code from that, and results in an (almost) end-to-end certification of correctness in the resultant software artifact.
2017-09-28 13:59:43	merijn	cdt5050: I can honestly say that I can't think of a single thing those two have in common, beyond things like "named identifiers exists"
2017-09-28 14:00:03	cdt5050	merijn: prolog is writing code by writing proofs of what you want your program to do.
2017-09-28 14:00:08	+beaky	yes both coq and prolog are pretty 'interactive' to wrok with

2017-09-28 14:06:08	merijn	Tazmain: They are now working on verified optimisation passes (i.e. optimisations that provably do not change the programs behaviour), which is a game changer for critical systems, because currently everyone basically uses -O0 since the optimizers in gcc/clang are way too buggy
2017-09-28 14:06:12	Tazmain	and then design and datastructures

2017-10-02 09:06:00	+PlanckWalk	soryy708: Trying to set up difference source code is a world of grief.
2017-10-02 09:06:02	+PlanckWalk	Don't do it.

2017-10-02 09:06:18	soryy708	PlanckWalk: What?

2017-10-02 09:06:50	+PlanckWalk	The idea is that the production servers will be running code identical to your shiny new development code, when it's complete.
2017-10-02 09:07:08	+PlanckWalk	The external configuration may be different, but try to minimize those differences as well.
2017-10-02 09:07:38	soryy708	I'm trying to decide on how to manage that difference. Through environment variables, or through source control.

2017-10-02 09:08:33	+PlanckWalk	Definitely not source control.  Preferably not through environment variables either.
2017-10-02 09:08:43	soryy708	How would you rather do it then?
2017-10-02 09:09:31	+PlanckWalk	Ideally, a virtual machine (or cluster of virtual machines) that is internally as close to identical as possible to the production environment.
2017-10-02 09:10:08	soryy708	PlanckWalk: What does it have to do with difference in source code?
2017-10-02 09:10:13	+PlanckWalk	Nothing at all.
2017-10-02 09:10:21	+PlanckWalk	There should be no differences in source code.
2017-10-02 09:10:31	soryy708	PlanckWalk: There has to be.
2017-10-02 09:10:33	+PlanckWalk	Nope
2017-10-02 09:11:12	+exio4	the only changes should be the ones you are testing/developing
2017-10-02 09:11:21	+PlanckWalk	If you have hardcoded resources in your source code that have to be changed between production.testing/production, get them out.  It's going to break something.
2017-10-02 09:11:31	+PlanckWalk	Err, development/testing/production
