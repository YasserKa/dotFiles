2017-06-18 21:27:17	yasser	occultus test
2017-06-18 21:27:27	yasser	occultus: test
2017-06-18 21:27:31	occultus	those all work but @ signs annoy some people
2017-06-18 21:27:44	yasser	wait, it's working?
2017-06-18 21:28:04	yasser	ah, stupid me. Of course I won't notice.
2017-06-18 21:28:21	yasser	It should be at the start of the line?
2017-06-18 21:28:30	yasser	or can I use occultus: ?
2017-06-18 21:28:31	occultus	any time anyone types anything that I can see with my nick anywhere inside it it gets highlighted
2017-06-18 21:28:41	yasser	ah
2017-06-18 21:28:46	yasser	thanks for your time.
2017-06-18 21:29:02	occultus	usually though
2017-06-18 21:29:12	occultus	yasser: this format is what people use
2017-06-18 21:29:40	yasser	I am comfortable with the @ since I come from slack and discord.
2017-06-18 21:29:53	yasser	Why they got annoyed by it though>
2017-06-18 21:30:01	yasser	get*
2017-06-18 21:32:34	occultus	some people get annoyed probably because they know it from twitter and think twitter is annoying
2017-06-18 21:32:44	occultus	or because the @ sign is extra, you don't need it in IRC
2017-06-18 22:13:37	yasser	twitter is annoying?
2017-06-18 22:16:17	occultus	they may at least think bringing twitterisms into IRC is annoying
2017-06-18 22:17:51	yasser	What's twitterisms?
2017-06-18 22:18:50	occultus	-isms just means "things from it or associated with it"
2017-06-18 22:19:06	occultus	so twitterisms means "twitter things" -- like @ signs and hashtags
2017-06-18 22:20:15	yasser	That exists in many other media stuff though.
2017-06-18 22:20:23	yasser	It exists in slack and discord.
2017-06-18 22:21:29	occultus	really @ predates twitter too but twitter made them mainstream
2017-06-18 22:21:51	yasser	Ah, okay. I didn't use twitter myself, so I can't say.
