Jolie Johnson answered the question "What are some amazing psychology and m=
ind tricks?":

"It is said that the pilots of the US air force after the Korean war massiv=
ely passed training, during which they were trained to resist the psycholog=
ical effects of the enemy. It is also said that psychological torture is mu=
ch more effective than physical torture: the human psyche recovers from suc=
h an impact for a long time... And they say that the CIA has developed a wh=
ole system of"non-human impact". These are just some examples from the"tort=
ure Report".

The intelligence Committee of the us Senate in 2014 published a shortened v=
ersion of its study on the use of torture in the CIA. The public document c=
ontains 528 pages describing CIA "enhanced interrogation techniques".

Methods of psychological and physical impact on prisoners were developed by=
 psychologists who previously collaborated with the school of survival in e=
mergency conditions of the US air force.

According to the human rights research Center of the Americas, psychologica=
l torture should meet the following four criteria:

1. Suffering;

2. Punishment;

3. Duration;

4. The absence of direct physical violence.

Lack of sleep

Lack of sleep us state Department, torture, us, CIA

Sleep deprivation is a form of torture where a prisoner is deprived of slee=
p for a long time. Sleep is vital for humans and animals. It is not yet cle=
ar how long a person can stay awake. Today, the set record belongs to Randy=
 Gardner, who was awake for 264.4 hours without the use of stimulants.

Methods, depriving of sleep, play loud blasting music, bright strobe lights=
, and the placement of man on step of the podium, from which, falling, he r=
eceives an electric shock... After a certain period of time without sleep, =
hallucinations begin. If the lack of sleep becomes permanent for several mo=
nths, it leads to mental illness.

Other, lighter, consequences may include deterioration of emotional state. =
David Dinges, Professor of psychology and Director of experimental psychiat=
ry at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that "when a person is deprive=
d of sleep, he ceases to experience positive emotions. He may claim to be h=
appy =E2=80=94 but he doesn't really experience anything."

Ostracism

Ostracism, the U.S. state Department, torture, United States, CIA

Social stigma is a form of psychological torture, which is rooted in the Mi=
ddle ages. Do you remember the term "pillory"? Here we are: the first menti=
on of this beautiful device dates back to 1274. So this torture has a long =
history.

Shameful pole with holes for the head and hands of the man was installed in=
 the most crowded place: in the shopping area or at the town hall. It allow=
ed to humiliate the guilty, to scold him, to throw stones at him and even s=
ometimes to beat.

An interesting case occurred in 1703, when Danielle Defo was sentenced to a=
 "pillory" for libel. However, public opinion of him as a hero was so high =
that he was thrown flowers, not dirt or excrement.

15 most sophisticated psychological torture of the us state Department, tor=
ture, us, CIA

At a time when Saddam Hussein was in power, one of the most famous prisons =
in the world was Abu Ghraib. After Hussein was overthrown, it housed the us=
 military prison. It turned out that the us army mocked the captive Iraqis.=
 A nationwide scandal broke out and eleven soldiers were convicted of crime=
s.

One of the forms of torture used in Abu Ghraib was forced nudity. Male pris=
oners were forcibly stripped naked and forced to stand in front of others i=
n which the mother gave birth.

In Arab culture, nudity and nudity in front of others are humiliating for m=
en.

Insulation

The isolation of the US state Department, torture, United States, CIA

One of the favorite methods of psychological pressure is the long-term isol=
ation of the prisoner. A former prisoner, Gairat Bahir, recalled:

- If you don't cooperate, they lock you in a box as long as the coffin, whe=
re there is no oxygen. No light. You feel like you're being buried alive.

Isolation or solitary confinement is used in some US prisons.

What are the consequences of such a conclusion for a person? In the infamou=
s 'pit of despair' experience of the macaques, conducted in the 1950s, psyc=
hologist Harry Harlow found that in a day or two the animals ' became deepl=
y restless, indifferent, or anxious. Roamed the cage, crippling themselves =
or swaying madly from side to side, not responding."

Sound

Sound torture is used to influence prisoners with loud music or white noise=
. Compared to physical torture, so-called "no touch" torture could be consi=
dered more humane, but it is no less effective.

Like the infamous pillar, sound torture has a long history =E2=80=94 let's =
say we know an Aztec form of torture called the death whistle.

The CIA playlist often contains singles such as Enter Sandman's Metallica, =
the hit Rage Against the Machine - Killing in the Name of or even Deicide, =
and their unforgettable F*ck Your God. What about the most popular song in =
Guantanamo? - "I love you" by Barney.

In the school of survival in difficult conditions continuously sound "Steps=
" by Rudyard Kipling.

Sergeant mark Hadsell of Psychological operations States that if a person h=
as never listened to heavy metal, he is not able to sustain the day and nig=
ht with this music =E2=80=94 "the brain and the body begin to lose their fu=
nctions. The thought slows down and the will is broken."

Drug manipulation

Manipulation with drugs, the US state Department, torture, United States, C=
IA

Drug use, especially hallucinogens, was often used in psychological torture=
. In the infamous program called Project MK-ULTRA, the CIA experimented wit=
h controlling mental activity. These experiments contained drugs to " weake=
n the will of the individual through control of mental operations."

MK means that the project was organized for CIA technical services, while "=
Ultra" is usually used to refer to secret intelligence data from the second=
 world war.

The most common drug is LSD, although the Agency has also experimented with=
 the development of truth sera. The CIA's own website gives a report on the=
 types of drugs used to establish the truth: different serums, including sc=
opolamine and various barbiturates.

- There is no such magical means as in the movies. Barbiturates, by reducin=
g defense mechanisms, can sometimes be useful in interrogation, but even in=
 the best cases they will cause illusions, fantasies, distorted speech, etc.

Fake death.

Fake the death of the US state Department, torture, United States, CIA

Remember how the great Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky described his exper=
iences when he was waiting for the death penalty, at the last moment was re=
placed by a link? This experience changed his whole life...

Until now, this type of psychological impact is considered one of the most =
effective and widely used in practice in various countries. From staging th=
e shooting and hanging to partial "strangulation" or "drowning".

Another form is "waiting" for death-being on the so-called "death penalty l=
ist". To say that the consequences are irreversible inmates are suicidal, o=
r have become a different kind of mania.

Extreme temperature

Extreme temperatures us state Department, torture, us, CIA

The use of extreme temperatures is one of the "enhanced interrogation" opti=
ons used by the CIA and the FBI. Despite the fact that this torture include=
s physical impact, it is considered psychological because it has a mental i=
mpact.

Temperature reduction is also used for sleep deprivation. However, hypother=
mia is a common side effect, this form of torture has a high mortality rate=
 - up to 50%. Lowering the temperature could affect the memory of the priso=
ners are suffering from amnesia. Using extremely high temperatures can lead=
 to thermal shock. Even if the necessary conditions are met, heat stroke is=
 usually fatal, so this form of torture can no longer be regarded as psycho=
logical.

Fear

Fear of us state Department, torture, us, CIA

The use of fears and phobias of prisoners can be effective, but not always =
feasible. The placement of arachnophobes in the same cell with spiders is o=
ne of the forms of such torture. It involves a deep knowledge of the victim=
, so it is unlikely to be used in the "official" setting.

Military psychologists questioned detainees in Guantanamo to understand whi=
ch of the phobias were used: the phobias of nudity, the phobias of enclosed=
 space, the phobias of darkness...

Tactile deprivation

Tactile deprivation, the US state Department, torture, United States, CIA

Sensory deprivation is an extreme form of psychological torture. This means=
 you can't hear, see, or touch anything. Imagine yourself trapped in a soun=
dproof chamber.

Microsoft has this =E2=80=94 they are testing equipment there. The noise le=
vel inside is a record-20.35 decibels. To make the camera even quieter, Mic=
rosoft says, is impossible because of moving air particles that collide wit=
h each other. Talking inside the room, completely isolated from the outside=
 noise, is very difficult, there is a feeling that you are shouting into th=
e pillow. Microsoft uses the audio lab to improve its own products. For exa=
mple, it can enhance the "hearing" of the voice assistant when the user acc=
esses a Windows device from the other end of the room, and tablets and lapt=
ops-to learn to perceive subtle signals.

In the case of psychological torture, it doesn't look so nice. Jos=C3=A9 Pa=
dilla was found guilty of aiding and abetting terrorists in 2007. In prison=
, he was subjected to sensory deprivation for several weeks. For 3.5 years =
he was kept in a cell without natural light, there was no clock or calendar=
."
